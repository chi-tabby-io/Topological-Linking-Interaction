    I like this one. Finds a regular projection of the SAW by rotating 
    the axes CCW (or conversely, by rotating the SAW CW) by an irrational
    angle, thus guaranteeing that no multiple points are triple, and that
    no two vertices are projected to the same point (vertices are at most
    single points).

    (Note that the angle is completely arbitrary, so I chose PI/3)
    (CHANGELOG: added second y-rotation by pi / 6 on 10/04/2021)
